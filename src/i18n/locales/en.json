    "title": "Born and raised in Argentina",
    "description": "I am the founder of Gates to Argentina, a boutique agency born from a solid international background. For over 15 years, I led tour operations in the Middle East through Gates to Israel, managing more than 500 groups and perfecting the art of travel logistics. Our firm is distinguished by offering trilingual service (Spanish, English, and Hebrew) and 24/7 support, ensuring that every detail of your trip is covered. Although our original headquarters were in Israel, today we operate with offices in Tucumán, New York, and Israel, building bridges between continents. My role has always been one of 'courage and logistics.' After returning to Argentina in 2023, I apply that same rigor and passion to designing personalized programs that combine adventure, culture, and comfort in one of South America's most fascinating countries.",
